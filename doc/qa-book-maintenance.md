# QA Book Maintenance

Add any items that need to be added to the [QA Book](https://github.com/phetsims/QA/blob/master/doc/qa-book.md) to this markdown file.

## Small Things

- [x] Add places to find sim specific terminology and query parameters.
- [ ] Add documentation of any useful query parameters not necessarily used in RC testing.
- [ ] Add [process for Metacog maintenance testing](https://github.com/phetsims/QA/issues/187#issue-360088338). See [this issue](https://github.com/phetsims/QA/issues/191). Formatting doesnâ€™t look great though, so maybe we should take a second look there.
- [ ] Add documentation for new labeling system.

## Big Things

- [ ] Rework website translation cases for clarity.
- [ ] Rework screenshot process for clarity.
- [ ] Add new website translation steps.
- [x] "Opening the Console
The console is a workspace which shows and allows access to the internal workings of a webpage. It is used often in testing to make sure that the sim is doing what it should be. To access the console, right click and click on the option which says Inspect, or Inspect Element. Then click the console button. The hotkey for Mac is Command+Option+i and for Windows is Control+Shift+i. " and then a reminder later:
" make sure to have the console open! It is either helpful or required for the testing. Refer to the Opening the Console section to see how to open a console on your browser."
- [x] Add a Maintenance release testing section. Include problems with launching Instance Proxies
